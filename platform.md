 **CityEyes** is a powerful name — it suggests awareness, intelligence, and urban vision.

Below is a refined, investor-ready **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** built specifically around the brand **CityEyes**.

# 📍 PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)

# **CityEyes**

*See the city. Navigate with confidence.*

---

## 1. Product Overview

**CityEyes** is a real-time landmark intelligence and navigation mobile application that helps tourists, drivers, and urban explorers locate verified landmarks around them.

Unlike traditional map apps that rely heavily on street names and structured addresses, CityEyes focuses on **human-recognizable landmarks** — the way people actually give directions in cities.

Example:

> “Turn right after the Shell Filling Station.”
> “Opposite the Blue Gate Pharmacy.”

CityEyes makes these directions searchable, navigable, and shareable.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

In many cities — especially across Africa and emerging markets:

* Addresses are inconsistent or non-standard.
* People give directions using landmarks.
* Tourists struggle with informal location systems.
* Drivers waste time calling for clarification.
* Deliveries fail due to vague address descriptions.

Traditional platforms like:

* Google Maps
* Waze

do not deeply capture informal, culturally relevant landmarks.

**CityEyes bridges that gap.**
